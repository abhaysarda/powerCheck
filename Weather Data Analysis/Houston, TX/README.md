# Houston Analysis

Our analysis of Houston data consists of using kNN, penalized SVM, random forests, AdaBoost, Gradient Tree Boosting and Neural Networks.

The Neural networks folder contains the neural network implementation, while all the others are in the Houston Analysis notebook.

All the code is in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and can be run in a default installation.
