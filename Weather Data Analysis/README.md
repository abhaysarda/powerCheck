# Weather Data Analysis

The different folders represent the four states where power outages are most frequent. Since it is inherently an imbalanced classification problem, we focused on states where power outages are most frequent.

The two states that we analyzed were Houston and Michigan. California and North/South Carolina were not analyzed in the span of the project.
