# Michigan analysis

Our analysis for Michigan consisted of kNN, penalized SVM, Random Forests, AdaBoost and Gradient Tree Boosting Algorithms.  

We got quite high recall(96%) for predicting actual power outages, with our best all rounder model giving about 65% accuracy for both classes.  

# Layout

The "kNN and Comparison between States" folder houses the code for the data cleaning and analysis of Michigan data, and also contains a comparison between Michigan and Indiana.

The "Random Forest Variants" folder contains the Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost and Gradient Tree Boosting algorithms.
