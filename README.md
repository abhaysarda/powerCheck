Predicting power outage using night lights data set


We are working on building and training a model capable of predicting power outages at a spatial resolution of 1km. Staying informed about a possible power outage is crucial to organizations such as hospitals and factories, especially in developing countries. We will be working with the Night Lights dataset and use the electrical disturbance data to determine the accuracy of the model. The main challenges we will be addressing over the course of this project are identifying the right algorithm to use with the data, and usage of appropriate data structures to organize data and boost efficiency.
