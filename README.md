Predicting power outage using weather forecast data

Our model predicts the possibility of a power outage based on the current weather conditions in a region. Using the historical weather records from Climate Data Online and the Electrical Disturbances OE-417 Data from the Department of Energy, it is able to predict accurately most of the power outages in a region.

For a proof of concept, we have focused on Texas, Houston and Michigan, Ann Arbor. We also tested our model's potential for transfer learning by testing it on a neighboring state of Michigan, Indiana.
